  ### Data cleaning and preparations
  ---
  The initial data preparation phase involves:

1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Handling missing values through imputation/interpolation
3. Cleaning data to resolve errors/inconsistencies
4. Formatting data for consistency and analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
(EDA)is a critical step in understanding the data and guiding the analysis. Through EDA, I explore the data to answer key questions:

- What patterns and relationships exist within the data?
- What variables are most influential or predictive?
- Where are the data's strengths and weaknesses?
- What insights can be gleaned from summary statistics and visualizations?
- What are the most significant correlations or trends?

  ### Data Analysis
- This is where i include some basic lines of code or queries or some of the function i worked with during my analysis;
- 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
