### Project Overview: 
---
 This repository chronicles my data analysis training experience, detailing the skills, techniques, and tools I've acquired along the way. It serves as a portfolio of projects, exercises, and insights gained from various courses, workshops, and self-directed learning. Each entry highlights specific analytical methods, data visualizations, and real-world applications, offering a comprehensive view of my progress in the field of data analysis. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and prepare me for real-world data science challenges. Through a series of projects and exercises, I develop and showcase skills in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization and communication
- Statistical analysis and modeling

### Data sources:

### Data Used:
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. for Data cleaning
  2. for Analysis
  3. for Data Vitualization
- SQL- Structured Query Language
- Github for portolio Building

  ### Data cleaning and preparations
  ---
  The initial data preparation phase involves:

1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Handling missing values through imputation/interpolation
3. Cleaning data to resolve errors/inconsistencies
4. Formatting data for consistency and analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
---
(EDA)is a critical step in understanding the data and guiding the analysis. Through EDA, I explore the data to answer key questions:

- What patterns and relationships exist within the data?
- What variables are most influential or predictive?
- Where are the data's strengths and weaknesses?
- What insights can be gleaned from summary statistics and visualizations?
- What are the most significant correlations or trends?

  ### Data Analysis
- This is where i include some basic lines of code or queries or some of the function i worked with during my analysis;
- 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
